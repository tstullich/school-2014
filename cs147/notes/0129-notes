Clock Model (For an ALU)
* ALU and rest of the system need to work together
* Outside forces (temp, electrical noise) can affect the calculation time
* Internal clock schedules tasks and when they should be finished
* Clock helps synchronize the timing
* The clock ticks at varying speeds in different systems (Usually GHz range)
* Clock is an electrical signal which various continuously between 0 and 1
* 0 represents the ground (GND) and 1 is the logic state (UDD)
* Clock can have a rising edge and falling edge
* The time between two rising edges is called T
* The frequency (F) of the clock is calculated by F = 1/T
* The duty cycle is a percentage of the time the clock is in a high state
* It is calculated by D = (Tn / T) * 100
* Usually there is a "ramp-up" time between high and low state. Not immmediate
* The midpoint between the high and low state is where ramp-up time is calculated

Memory System Model
* Provides storage capability for information (instructions and data)
* Using this model we can introduce cycles to the clock model
* Reset cycles reset the memory
* Read cyles read from the memory
* Write cycles write to the memory
* Group of temp registers can be modeled as memory with distinct data in out port
* Register files can sit on the process and can store data for longer
* We can also split up the data port to in and out
* Only a limited number of registers, or register files can be implemented with more parallel operation
* We can mulitple data outs in order to read registers in parallel
* This overcomes the limitation of reading registers one at a time
* This also streamlines ALU and Register operations to run in parallel

Control System Model
* Instructions from the ALU and registers need to be controlled
* The control unit takes care of the flow between 3 components:
  * ALU, Registers, Memory
* All of these units together could roughly be called a processor
* JMP instructions simply increase the program counter 
* Memory can sit either on the chip or outside of it but nowadays is more prominent on chip
* The general algorithm for running programs is laid out in the slides
* Some instructions can be directly encoded on the memory
  * They can bypass the registers all together

Architectures
Von Neumann Architecture
  * One way to design a processing unit
    * Contains a Control Unit, ALU, and Memory
Harvard Architecture
  * Addresses an issue with the Von Neumann arch
     * Memory is locked during write backs and halts the processor
  * Allows instruction execution and memory writes at the same time
